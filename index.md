# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about ...

My current career goals.

Presently I have the foundational knowledge required to find an entry level job in the development field, however, I do not have sufficient experience in the field be it with clients or with personal projects to showcase what I'm capable of.

Thus, today I finally made a github account, something I truthfully should have done years ago, and am going to put forth my best efforts to showcase my worth and learning capabilities with the projects I involve myself in.

Github has plenty of courses on programming languages I'm currently unfamilar with, so I view this as an incredibly great opportunity to continue moving forward!
